Box Drawer
This is the part of the library that draws a box.
When calling the function that returns a string, whoever's calling it can define (respectively) the box's width (measured in characters), which characters that'll fill the top and lower boundaries and the sides of the box (separately), how many cells per row the box will have, the title for the box, and finally the items (strings) to fill the cells (as many as they like).
